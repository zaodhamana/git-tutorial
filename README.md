# Git tutorial README file
This is the first README from Visual Studio Code tutorial.
It took rather long to set up the remote connection, but I learnt a lot in the process about ssh, signing and connecting. 
Now I'll continue to push by using git and github as my only method of tracking my coding.
I'll come back to add to this branches - and do this all over again.
