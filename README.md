# Git tutorial README file
This is the first README from Visual Studio Code tutorial.
It took rather long to set up the remote connection, but I learnt a lot in the process about ssh, signing and connecting. 
Now I'll continue to push by using git and github as my only method of tracking my coding.
I'll come back to add to this branches - and do this all over again.
2nd day and now more comfortable with git, a newly minted novice, and working on two folders openned in VS code, simultaneously, split screen, one folder a clone of the same repos - and editing, pulling, resolving merge conflicts as i push and pull to keep them up to date between edits initiated in branches. 
I'm now trying out codespace to see how it feels to work on cloud and track the changes.I have seen the set up of origin, pulling and resolving conflicts when origin and codespace were in conflict - i will use a branch in the next commit from codespace.
Main lesson is that in codespace you need to define remote and branch with each pull and push, second lesson is you have to then pull and update with each push all other folders, each time you update the Github origin.
